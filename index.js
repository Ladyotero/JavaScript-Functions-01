Underneath the golden sun, Waves are crashing, everyone, 
Tacos in the sun, life has just begun, On the beach, we're having fun, 
Pickleball at dawn, travel 'til we're gone, This is how we run, 
this is life we love! Journey far and roam the skies, 
Life's adventure never dies, Tacos in the sun, 
life has just begun, On the beach, we're having fun, Pickleball at dawn, 
travel 'til we're gone, This is how we run, this is life we love!
